Former **anonymous, short-lived work chat** ðŸ’¬

## Purpose

Decompresso aimed to provide an independant and secure platform to chat anonymously with your coworkers, in order to open up on topics that would not usually be discussed.

## How it worked

After signing up with their **professional email address** and verifying it, users would get matched into a common chat room based on the email address domain and assigned a random nickname. 

Every week, on sunday everning, a purge would happen and wipe all chat messages to start fresh.
